在 AWS 的背景下，**安全组（Security Group）**是有状态的，而**网络访问控制列表（Network ACL，简称 NACL）**是无状态的。

### 有状态与无状态的定义

- **有状态（Stateful）**：
  - 有状态的防火墙会跟踪连接状态。这意味着，如果你允许某个入站流量（如从外部访问你的实例），相应的出站流量会自动被允许，无需单独配置。
  - 例如，在安全组中，如果你允许某个 IP 地址的入站流量，AWS 会自动允许从该实例到该 IP 地址的出站流量。

- **无状态（Stateless）**：
  - 无状态的防火墙不会跟踪连接状态。每个请求都需要单独的规则来允许入站和出站流量。
  - 例如，在 NACL 中，如果你允许某个 IP 地址的入站流量，你还需要单独配置出站流量规则，才能允许从该实例回传数据。

### 总结

- **安全组**：有状态，自动处理返回流量。
- **网络 ACL**：无状态，需要单独配置入站和出站规则。
